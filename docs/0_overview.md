### **Tech Breakdown for Army Building Game (Offline, Python-based)**

Given the game's offline nature with Python handling both the frontend and backend execution, here's a detailed breakdown of the **topics and areas to focus on** from a technical perspective.

---

### **1. Game Architecture**

**Objective**: Design a game engine that handles the execution of battle scripts for both players.

- **Game Flow**:
  - Players submit scripts that define the actions for each turn.
  - Each step is executed sequentially for both users, handling the movement and attack of units.
  - A loop runs to alternate between each player’s actions.

- **Components**:
  - **Frontend**: Python-based interface where users input scripts and display results.
  - **Backend**: Python logic to simulate the battle (unit movement, conditions, actions, effects).
  - **Game Engine**: Core logic to handle turn-based execution, unit interactions, and updates.
  - **Data Storage**: In-memory structures to hold current state (units, positions, health, resources).

---

### **2. Game State Management**

**Objective**: Define and manage the game state effectively.

- **Entities**:
  - **Players**: Two players (left and right).
  - **Units**: Different types of units with properties (health, armor, attack, etc.).
  - **Resources**: Gold, wood, iron, food — tracked throughout the game.
  - **Terrains**: Land, water, forest, mountains — affecting unit movement.
  - **Buildings**: Construction, upgrades, and resource gathering.

- **State Variables**:
  - **Player States**: Current player’s script, units, resources.
  - **Battle Map**: 2D grid (for terrain, unit positions).
  - **Unit Stats**: Health, attack, defense, movement, range, and any special abilities.
  - **Turn Tracker**: Which player’s turn it is and when to switch.

---

### **3. Game Logic and Execution**

**Objective**: Define how scripts and steps are processed.

- **Script Parsing**:
  - **Input**: User scripts describing conditions, actions, and effects.
  - **Execution Flow**: For each step:
    1. Parse the conditions (e.g., "if enemy unit is within range").
    2. Execute actions (e.g., "move unit" or "attack enemy").
    3. Apply effects (e.g., damage, movement, buffs).
  
- **Action Execution**:
  - For each step, execute the respective action on the battlefield (e.g., move, attack, heal).
  - Handle condition checks dynamically based on unit states (health, location).
  
- **Turn-based Mechanism**:
  - Alternate between players' actions:
    - Run all steps for Player 1 (left).
    - Run all steps for Player 2 (right).

---

### **4. Unit Movement and Interaction**

**Objective**: Implement the movement system and interaction between units.

- **Movement Rules**:
  - **Grid-based Movement**: Units move one or more tiles based on terrain.
  - **Movement Constraints**: Some units may be restricted by terrain (e.g., naval units cannot move on land).
  - **Range**: For ranged units like archers, define attack ranges based on proximity.

- **Unit Interactions**:
  - **Combat**: Define how units interact in battle (e.g., melee, ranged, special abilities).
  - **Attack/Defense**: Combat mechanics with attack strength vs. defense/armor.
  - **Health**: Decrease health upon receiving damage, check for unit survival.
  - **Buffs and Debuffs**: Apply positive and negative effects based on script actions.

---

### **5. Battle Map and Terrain Handling**

**Objective**: Implement a dynamic battle map that reflects the terrain and unit positions.

- **Grid Representation**:
  - **2D Grid**: Represent the map as a grid, with different terrains placed randomly or predefined.
  - **Unit Placement**: Place units on the grid based on the user’s choice and the battle map setup.

- **Terrain Effects**:
  - **Movement Restrictions**: Some units may be restricted on certain terrains (e.g., water or mountains).
  - **Cover and Visibility**: Forests might offer cover for units, affecting the attack or defense.

- **Visual Representation**:
  - **Frontend Visualization**: Display the battle map to the user, showing unit positions, health bars, and terrain types.

---

### **6. Script Execution and Turn Management**

**Objective**: Handle user scripts, turn-taking, and execution of actions.

- **Script Format**:
  - Define a consistent format for user scripts (conditions, actions, effects).
  - Scripts are processed one step at a time, where each action is executed on the units or terrain.

- **Turn Management**:
  - After each step, update the game state (unit positions, health, resources).
  - After Player 1 completes a turn, switch to Player 2 and repeat the process.

---

### **7. Handling Conditions, Actions, and Effects**

**Objective**: Dynamically evaluate conditions and apply actions and effects.

- **Conditions**:
  - Check if certain conditions are true (e.g., unit health below threshold, enemy within range).
  - Condition types can include:
    - **Health-based** (e.g., "if unit health < 50%").
    - **Proximity-based** (e.g., "if enemy is within range").
    - **Resource-based** (e.g., "if enough food is available").

- **Actions**:
  - Execute actions like move, attack, or heal based on conditions.
  - Actions should modify the state of the units or resources accordingly.

- **Effects**:
  - Implement the impact of actions, such as reducing health or increasing resources.

---

### **8. Unit AI (Optional)**

**Objective**: Implement simple AI behavior for units to make strategic decisions during battles.

- **AI-Based Movement**:
  - Define simple logic for unit behavior, such as prioritizing targets, avoiding obstacles, or seeking cover.

- **Automated Scripting**:
  - Optionally, allow the AI to generate its own scripts for moves based on the current state of the game.

---

### **9. Resource Management and Economics**

**Objective**: Track and manage resources throughout the game.

- **Resource Accumulation**:
  - Players gather resources over time based on map elements (e.g., gold mines, wood forests).
  
- **Resource Spending**:
  - Each unit and building construction requires specific resources (gold, wood, iron).
  - Track resources as they are used during the game.

- **Resource Impact on Strategy**:
  - Players need to make strategic choices on how to allocate resources (e.g., spend resources on army expansion vs. defense).

---

### **10. Frontend Development (Python-based)**

**Objective**: Build a Python-based frontend for interacting with the game.

- **User Interface**:
  - Create a user interface using libraries like **Tkinter** or **PyQt** for handling user inputs and displaying results.
  - The frontend should accept script inputs and show the game map and results.

- **User Input**:
  - Provide text boxes or scripting environments for users to input their battle scripts.
  - Allow users to submit scripts one step at a time, for each turn.

- **Visual Feedback**:
  - Show the battle map with updated unit positions, health, and terrain effects after each step.
  
---

### **11. Backend Logic (Python-based)**

**Objective**: Develop the Python backend to handle script execution and game logic.

- **Execution Engine**:
  - A module that interprets the battle script, checks conditions, performs actions, and updates the game state accordingly.
  - Handles interactions between units, terrain effects, and resources.

- **Unit State**:
  - Track unit status such as position, health, attack power, defense, etc.
  - Ensure updates after every action taken.

- **Game Engine Loop**:
  - Implement a main game loop that alternates turns between the two players and processes their scripts.

---

### **12. Testing & Debugging**

**Objective**: Ensure the game engine, scripts, and user interactions are functioning as expected.

- **Unit Testing**:
  - Write tests to ensure the game logic (e.g., unit movement, combat) works correctly.
  - Test condition checks, resource management, and turn management.

- **Debugging**:
  - Implement logs to track game states and actions during testing.
  - Use visual feedback to debug player scripts and the battle state.

---

### **13. Performance Optimization**

**Objective**: Ensure smooth performance and responsiveness of the game.

- **Efficient Script Parsing**:
  - Parse and execute scripts efficiently to handle large numbers of steps and conditions.

- **Rendering Optimization**:
  - Optimize rendering of game maps and unit updates for better user experience.

- **Turn Execution**:
  - Optimize the game engine loop for minimal lag between turns.

---

### **14. Game Balance**

**Objective**: Ensure fair gameplay and challenge balance.

- **Unit Balancing**:
  - Ensure that no unit is too powerful or too weak for the strategy.
  
- **Resource Management**:
  - Adjust resource generation and consumption to ensure balanced economic gameplay.
