### **Next Topic: Data Model and Game State Management**

For a game like this, proper data modeling and efficient game state management are crucial. Here's a breakdown of the elements that need to be modeled and managed within the game:

---

#### **1. Game State Structure**

The game state is essentially a snapshot of the entire game at any given moment. It must include:
- The positions and statuses of units
- Resources available to each player
- Terrains and their attributes
- Events, actions, and effects

---

#### **2. Data Model Components**

##### **a. Units**

Each unit in the game should be modeled with the following attributes:

- **ID**: A unique identifier for each unit.
- **Type**: The class of unit (e.g., Infantry, Archer, Cavalry).
- **Health**: The health of the unit (an integer value).
- **Attack**: The base attack power of the unit.
- **Defense**: The base defense power of the unit.
- **Movement**: How many units a unit can move in one step (e.g., 1 for infantry, 2 for cavalry).
- **Range**: For ranged units, how far they can attack (e.g., archers).
- **Position**: The current grid position of the unit, typically represented as `(x, y)` coordinates.
- **Status**: The current condition of the unit (e.g., Alive, Dead, Healing).

**Example (Python Class Representation):**
```python
class Unit:
    def __init__(self, unit_id, unit_type, health, attack, defense, movement, range, position):
        self.unit_id = unit_id
        self.unit_type = unit_type
        self.health = health
        self.attack = attack
        self.defense = defense
        self.movement = movement
        self.range = range
        self.position = position
        self.status = "Alive"
```

##### **b. Terrain**

Terrain types should affect the gameplay, such as movement speed, defense, and visibility:

- **ID**: Unique identifier for the terrain.
- **Type**: The type of terrain (e.g., Land, Water, Mountain, Forest).
- **Movement Modifier**: How much the terrain affects unit movement (e.g., mountains might reduce movement, water might block movement entirely).
- **Defense Modifier**: How much the terrain affects defense (e.g., forests provide defense bonus, water provides no bonus).
  
**Example (Python Class Representation):**
```python
class Terrain:
    def __init__(self, terrain_type, movement_modifier, defense_modifier):
        self.terrain_type = terrain_type
        self.movement_modifier = movement_modifier
        self.defense_modifier = defense_modifier
```

##### **c. Resources**

The game will include resources like gold, wood, iron, and food, which are needed to build or upgrade units and structures:

- **ID**: Unique identifier for the resource.
- **Type**: The type of resource (e.g., Gold, Wood, Iron).
- **Amount**: The current amount of the resource that the player has.

**Example (Python Class Representation):**
```python
class Resource:
    def __init__(self, resource_type, amount):
        self.resource_type = resource_type
        self.amount = amount
```

##### **d. Player**

Each player will have a unique identity and a set of resources, units, and scripted actions:

- **ID**: Unique identifier for the player.
- **Name**: The player's name or identifier.
- **Units**: A list of units the player controls.
- **Resources**: A list of resources the player has.
- **Script**: The player’s current script for actions.
  
**Example (Python Class Representation):**
```python
class Player:
    def __init__(self, player_id, name):
        self.player_id = player_id
        self.name = name
        self.units = []
        self.resources = []
        self.script = []
```

##### **e. Game Map/Grid**

The game map represents the battle area, which will be divided into a grid. Each grid cell will either be empty or contain a terrain type and/or units.

- **Width**: The number of columns in the grid.
- **Height**: The number of rows in the grid.
- **Cells**: A 2D array representing the grid where each cell contains a terrain type, units, or resources.

**Example (Python Representation):**
```python
class GameMap:
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
        self.grid = [[None for _ in range(width)] for _ in range(height)]
```

##### **f. Action/Effect**

Each action that can be executed by the user must be modeled to handle the effects on the game state. Actions like moving units, attacking, or resource management will each have corresponding effects.

- **Action Type**: The type of action (e.g., move, attack, gather).
- **Target**: The target of the action (e.g., an enemy unit, a terrain).
- **Effect**: The outcome of the action (e.g., damage dealt, resources gained).

**Example (Python Class Representation):**
```python
class Action:
    def __init__(self, action_type, target, effect):
        self.action_type = action_type
        self.target = target
        self.effect = effect
```

---

#### **3. Game State Management**

The game state is continuously updated based on player actions, and it needs to be managed efficiently. Here's how it can be handled:

- **State Representation**: The state should be stored in an organized manner. A dictionary or JSON structure can be used to store the map, players, units, and resources.
- **Game Updates**: Each action taken by a player updates the game state. The game engine must modify the appropriate attributes (e.g., move a unit, update resource count, change unit health).
  
**Example:**
```python
class GameState:
    def __init__(self):
        self.players = []
        self.units = []
        self.resources = []
        self.map = GameMap(10, 10)  # Initialize a 10x10 map
        self.turn_counter = 0  # Track the number of turns
    
    def update_state(self, player, action):
        # Update units, resources, terrain, etc., based on the action
        pass
```

---

#### **4. State Persistence**

To allow the game to be resumed later, the state can be serialized and saved to a file (e.g., JSON, SQLite, or Pickle):

- **Game State Serialization**: Store the game state to a file after each step.
- **State Loading**: When a game is resumed, load the saved state back into the game engine.

Example (Saving and Loading Game State):
```python
import json

def save_game_state(game_state, filename="game_state.json"):
    with open(filename, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(game_state, f)

def load_game_state(filename="game_state.json"):
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        game_state = json.load(f)
    return game_state
```

---

#### **5. Real-time Game State Updates**

For a turn-based game, the updates happen after each player's turn. However, the frontend needs to refresh the game state visually after each action:

- **Frontend Polling**: After each turn, the frontend (UI) should query the backend for the current game state and display the updated map, units, resources, and stats.

---

### **6. Handling Game State Transitions**

Each action that modifies the game state must be tracked and executed in a way that maintains consistency:

- **Action Validation**: Before applying any action, ensure that it’s a valid move (e.g., unit is not moving through an impassable terrain, player has enough resources to perform an action).
- **Undo/Redo**: Consider adding undo/redo functionality to the game. You can store a history of states and allow players to revert to a previous turn.

---

### **7. Example Data Flow**

1. **Player Input**: Player 1 provides a script to move a unit and attack another.
2. **Engine Executes Script**: The game engine checks the conditions and executes the actions defined in the script.
3. **Game State Update**: The game state is updated based on the unit movements, attacks, and resource usage.
4. **Frontend Update**: The UI queries the updated game state and displays the changes (e.g., new unit positions, remaining health).
5. **Turn-Based Progression**: The game then proceeds to Player 2’s turn, following the same sequence.

---

### **8. Future Enhancements**

- **Multiple Game Modes**: Support for different maps, unit types, and custom rules for different game modes (e.g., survival, conquest).
- **Persistent Online Game States**: For online play, implement a database to store game states and allow players to resume games anytime.
- **More Complex Resource Management**: Introduce supply chains, resource production over time, or limited resource pools that players need to manage wisely.

This data model and game state management structure will ensure that the game behaves consistently and efficiently while providing players with a dynamic and strategic experience. The next step will be to move on to the script execution engine and how it will interpret the user's input to trigger actions within this model.
