### **Game Tech Architecture for Army Building Game**

The architecture for this Python-based offline Army Building Game involves a modular design, with clear separation between the game logic, frontend, and backend. Here's an overview of the architecture and file structure:

---

### **1. Game Architecture Overview**

#### **Frontend (User Interface)**:
- **Input**: Players submit their battle scripts and interact with the game interface.
- **Visualization**: Displays the battle map, unit statuses, and other game elements in real-time.
  
#### **Backend (Game Engine)**:
- **Script Parsing & Execution**: Interprets battle scripts and performs the actions defined by the players.
- **Game State**: Holds the current state of the game, including players, units, resources, terrain, and actions.
- **Turn Management**: Alternates turns between players, executes their actions in sequence, and updates the state.

#### **Data Management**:
- **In-Memory State**: A dynamic data structure to manage game entities, actions, and turn progression.
- **Logging**: Keeps logs for debugging and error tracking.

### **2. Game Components Breakdown**

- **Game Loop**: Alternates between players' turns, executes actions for each turn, updates the state, and checks for win conditions.
- **Script Parser**: Reads and interprets user-submitted scripts to determine unit actions (move, attack, heal).
- **Battle Map**: A 2D grid representing the terrain and unit positions.
- **Unit & Resource Manager**: Tracks the stats and resources of units, including health, movement, and attack capabilities.
- **Combat & Action Logic**: Resolves combat, resource usage, and condition-based actions (like healing or attacking).

### **4. Explanation of Key Files**

- **`game_engine.py`**:
  - Main game loop that alternates between player turns and updates the game state.
  - Handles the win conditions, turn-based progression, and calls the necessary modules to execute actions.
  
- **`unit.py`**:
  - Defines the structure of units (e.g., health, attack power, movement range).
  - Includes methods for combat and interactions between units.

- **`script_parser.py`**:
  - Parses user scripts into actionable commands (e.g., move unit, attack enemy).
  - Ensures the scripts are in the correct format and evaluates conditions dynamically.

- **`map.py`**:
  - Manages the battle map, including placing units and defining terrain.
  - Can incorporate a grid-based system for the map.

- **`main_window.py`**:
  - The primary GUI window that players interact with.
  - Handles input (script submission), displays the current state of the game (battle map, unit positions), and updates the UI after each turn.
@
- **`logger.py`**:
  - Utility for logging information during the game.
  - Useful for debugging and tracking the execution of actions and conditions.

- **`config.py`**:
  - Contains configuration settings that can adjust gameplay, such as unit stats, resource generation rates, or initial unit placements.

- **`test_game_engine.py`**:
  - Unit tests for game logic, ensuring that units interact as expected, and the battle mechanics work correctly.
  
- **`test_script_parser.py`**:
  - Tests for the script parsing logic, checking that scripts are correctly interpreted and actions are executed as intended.

### **5. Execution Flow (Game Process)**

1. **Start Game**: 
   - The user is presented with a simple UI to input their battle scripts.
  
2. **Parse Scripts**:
   - The scripts are parsed by `script_parser.py` to break them into individual actions (e.g., "move unit", "attack enemy").

3. **Game Loop**:
   - The game engine (`game_engine.py`) alternates between Player 1 and Player 2, executing their actions one at@ a time based on the parsed scripts.
  
4. **Turn Updates**:
   - After each player’s turn, the battle map and unit stats are updated, and the UI reflects these changes.
  
5. **End Condition**:
   - The game continues until one player wins, either by defeating all enemy units or fulfilling a specific condition (e.g., capturing an enemy base).

### **6. Conclusion**

This architecture and file structure provide a solid foundation for developing the Army Building Game. By dividing the project into clear components—core game logic, user interface, script parsing, and testing—it allows for easy maintenance and extensibility.
