### **Next Topic: Script Execution Engine**

The script execution engine will be the core component of the game that interprets the user scripts, evaluates conditions, executes actions, and applies effects to the game state. This engine will need to handle each step of the game, processing both players' scripts one at a time in each turn, and updating the game state accordingly.

---

#### **1. Script Format**

Each player provides a script that defines the actions to be taken by their units. These scripts will be executed step-by-step in a predefined format. The script should contain the following elements:

- **Condition**: A condition that needs to be satisfied for the action to be executed (e.g., "If enemy unit is within range").
- **Action**: The actual action to be performed (e.g., "Move unit to (x, y)", "Attack enemy unit").
- **Effect**: The result or consequence of executing the action (e.g., "Reduce health of enemy by 10", "Increase resources by 5").
  
Each script step can be broken down into these elements:

- **Step**: A unit of execution that contains a condition, an action, and its effects.
  
**Example:**
```python
class ScriptStep:
    def __init__(self, condition, action, effect):
        self.condition = condition  # A callable that checks if the action can be performed
        self.action = action        # The action to perform
        self.effect = effect        # The result of executing the action
```

---

#### **2. Script Parsing**

Scripts should be parsed into a format that the game engine can understand. This will involve converting the script’s natural language-like structure (or predefined actions) into executable code. For example, if the user provides a script that says:

- "If enemy unit is within range, move my unit to (x, y) and attack."

The script parsing system will convert this into a structured action with corresponding conditions and effects.

To parse the script, we need:
- **Condition Evaluation**: A system that can evaluate if the given condition holds true (e.g., "Is there an enemy unit within range?").
- **Action Execution**: A system to handle the action itself (e.g., "Move unit to a new position").
- **Effect Application**: A mechanism to apply the effect (e.g., reducing health, modifying resources).

---

#### **3. Condition Evaluation**

Each action step requires an associated condition that must be true before it’s executed. Conditions may involve comparisons, unit status, terrain types, and more. For example:

- **"If enemy unit is within range"**: The condition checks if an enemy unit is within a certain distance.
- **"If enough resources are available"**: The condition checks if the player has sufficient resources for an action.
- **"If unit is not in combat"**: Checks whether the unit is free to perform an action (not already engaged in battle).

Conditions need to be evaluated in real-time, and if the condition returns `True`, the corresponding action will be performed.

**Example Condition Evaluation:**
```python
class Condition:
    def __init__(self, check_func):
        self.check_func = check_func  # A callable that returns True/False
    
    def evaluate(self, game_state, player):
        return self.check_func(game_state, player)
```

- The `check_func` could be a function like:
```python
def enemy_within_range(game_state, player):
    # Logic to check if an enemy is within range of any unit
    return True  # Placeholder
```

---

#### **4. Action Execution**

Once a condition has been evaluated to be `True`, the corresponding action will be executed. Action execution should modify the game state by performing the specified tasks such as moving units, attacking, gathering resources, etc.

Example actions:
- **Move**: Move a unit to a new position.
- **Attack**: Decrease the health of an enemy unit.
- **Resource Management**: Increase or decrease resources based on certain conditions.
- **Unit Creation**: Create a new unit on the battlefield if resources allow.

**Example Action Execution:**
```python
class Action:
    def __init__(self, execute_func):
        self.execute_func = execute_func  # A callable to perform the action
    
    def execute(self, game_state, player):
        self.execute_func(game_state, player)
```

For instance, a move action might look like:
```python
def move_unit(game_state, player):
    # Logic to move a unit on the map
    pass
```

---

#### **5. Effect Application**

Once the action is executed, its effects must be applied. Effects could involve modifying unit health, changing resources, or updating the game map. The effect could also impact multiple attributes based on the action.

For example:
- **If attacking**: The effect could reduce the enemy unit's health based on attack power and defense.
- **If gathering resources**: The effect could add a certain amount of resources to the player’s inventory.

Effects need to be applied to the units, resources, and map positions.

**Example Effect Application:**
```python
class Effect:
    def __init__(self, effect_func):
        self.effect_func = effect_func  # A callable that applies the effect
    
    def apply(self, game_state, player):
        self.effect_func(game_state, player)
```

For example, applying an attack effect:
```python
def attack_enemy(game_state, player):
    # Logic to reduce health of an enemy unit
    pass
```

#### **6. Game Loop Integration**

In the game loop, each player's script will be executed step-by-step:
1. **Player 1’s turn**:
    - Parse Player 1's script.
    - Evaluate each condition.
    - If the condition is met, execute the corresponding action.
    - Apply the effects to the game state.
2. **Player 2’s turn**:
    - Repeat the same process for Player 2.

After each player’s turn, the game state should be updated, and the next step of the game should be executed.

**Game Loop Example:**
```python
def game_turn(game_state, player1, player2):
    # Execute Player 1's script
    for step in player1.script:
        if step.condition.evaluate(game_state, player1):
            step.action.execute(game_state, player1)
            step.effect.apply(game_state, player1)
    
    # Execute Player 2's script
    for step in player2.script:
        if step.condition.evaluate(game_state, player2):
            step.action.execute(game_state, player2)
            step.effect.apply(game_state, player2)
```

---

#### **7. Script Execution Flow**

- **Step 1**: Parse the script from the player input.
- **Step 2**: Evaluate conditions in order.
- **Step 3**: If the condition is met, execute the corresponding action.
- **Step 4**: Apply the effect of the action.
- **Step 5**: Move to the next action in the script and repeat the process.
- **Step 6**: After all actions are executed, update the game state, refresh the UI, and move to the next turn.

---

#### **8. Error Handling and Debugging**

The script execution engine must handle errors gracefully. Possible issues could include:
- Invalid actions (e.g., trying to move a unit into a blocked area).
- Conditions that cannot be evaluated correctly (e.g., no enemy unit in range when the script expects one).

**Error Handling Example:**
```python
def execute_script(game_state, player):
    try:
        for step in player.script:
            if step.condition.evaluate(game_state, player):
                step.action.execute(game_state, player)
                step.effect.apply(game_state, player)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error executing script: {e}")
        # Handle error, potentially rollback game state
```

---

### **9. Future Enhancements**

- **Scripting Language Support**: Consider allowing more advanced scripting, such as JSON-based or even user-defined DSLs (domain-specific languages) to increase flexibility.
- **AI Opponent Scripts**: Implement AI that can generate scripts based on conditions and strategies.
- **Event Triggers**: Implement additional triggers for special events (e.g., “If health falls below 20%, heal unit”).

The script execution engine will provide the game with its logic by interpreting each player's input and changing the game state accordingly. Next, we'll explore how to integrate this with the backend and frontend for user interaction and real-time game updates.
